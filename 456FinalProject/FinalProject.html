        <h1> Climate Change Increases Threat of Devastation for Disadvantaged Florida Citizens  </h1>
        <h2>By Chandler Lugo</h2>

        <h3> Hurricanes in Florida </h3>
            <p> 
                The state of Florida has a long history of experiencing devastating hurricanes 
                due to its geographic position. The state's pennisula juts out into the Atlantic Ocean
                and Gulf of Mexico, towards the Tropic of Cancer. It is here, near the tropics and over warm waters that 
                hurricanes are most likely to form. As these storms pass over Florida, the state is subject to coastal surges, 
                heavy rain, and winds that can reach over 155 miles per hour. As the Earth and its oceans become warmer with 
                climate change, major hurricanes, hurricanes Category 3 and above, are becoming more common in the Gulf. 
                The warmer air and sea temperatures create conditions in which hurricanes are more likely to form. 
                In the past 10 years, 8 major hurricanes and made landfall in the Southeastern United States, 4 of which hit 
                the coast of Florida. It is not just volume of storms that the state should worry about, but the strength and speed of them. 
                The higher volumes of warm waters cause the storms to grow bigger than they have in the past and take much longer to 
                dissapate after they make land fall.

        <h3> Hurricane Ian </h3>
            <p> 
                We witnesses the devastating effects of strong hurricanes in Florida recently. In 2022, Hurricane Ian developed just 
                of the Caribbean Sea and reached Category 4 as it hit the western coast of Florida and travelled northeast across the state. 
                Ian was recorded to have a 75 mile wind field along its eye's track with sustained winds reaching over 74 miles an hour with wind gusts well over 
                100 miles an hour. Category 4 hurricanes can produce winds up to 155 miles an hour. Ian caused
