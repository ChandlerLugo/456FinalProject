        <h1> Climate Change Increases Threat of Devastation for Disadvantaged Florida Citizens  </h1>
        <h2>By Chandler Lugo</h2>

        <h3> Hurricanes in Florida </h3>
            <p> 
                The state of Florida has a long history of experiencing devastating hurricanes 
                due to its geographic position. The state's pennisula juts out into the Atlantic Ocean
                and Gulf of Mexico, towards the Tropic of Cancer. It is here, near the tropics and over warm waters that 
                hurricanes are most likely to form. As these storms pass over Florida, the state is subject to coastal surges, 
                heavy rain, and winds that can reach over 155 miles per hour. As the Earth and its oceans become warmer with 
                climate change, major hurricanes, hurricanes Category 3 and above, are becoming more common in the Gulf. 
                The warmer air and sea temperatures create conditions in which hurricanes are more likely to form. 
                In the past 10 years, 8 major hurricanes and made landfall in the Southeastern United States, 4 of which hit 
                the coast of Florida. It is not just volume of storms that the state should worry about, but the strength and speed of them. 
                The higher volumes of warm waters cause the storms to grow bigger than they have in the past and take much longer to 
                dissapate after they make land fall. 
            </p>

        <h3> Hurricane Ian </h3>
            <p> 
                We witnesses the devastating effects of strong hurricanes in Florida recently. In 2022, Hurricane Ian developed in the 
                Caribbean Sea and reached Category 4 as it hit the western coast of Florida and travelled northeast across the state. 
                Ian was recorded to have a 75 mile wind field along its eye's track with sustained winds reaching over 74 miles an hour with wind gusts well over 
                100 miles an hour. Category 4 hurricanes can produce winds up to 155 miles an hour. Ian was the costliest natural disaster of 2022, causing 
                a reported 112.9 billion dollars in damage. Thats the third costliest hurricane since 1980. 
            </p>

        <h3> Mobile Homes in Florida </h3>
            <p>
              The congregation of trailer homes in Florida dates back to the establishment of manufacturing plants during World War II. 
              Workers could move closer to plants and live in small, cheap housing in the form of mobile homes/trailers. Mobile home "resorts" of the 1960s 
              started to attract retirees from across the U.S. with promises of warm weather and amenities like pools and club houses. Today, mobile home parks 
              provide low-cost housing, more mobilty, a sense of community, more housing in highly-sought after cities and towns, and the opportunity to own a 
              home. 
            </p>

        <h3> Disproportionate Threat </h3>
            <p>
              The quality of life with a relatively lower cost of living and an escape from harsh winters continues to attract retirees and 'snowbirds.' 
              But these benefits are starting to come at a cost. With the recent surge in strong, slow-moving hurricanes, senior citizens and low-income 
              families who live in mobile homes, specifically mobile parks, are at the highest risk of complete devastation. This is not just a weather problem, 
              it is a social and economic problem. Climate change is having a disproportionate effect on people in poverty and people, like retirees, with no 
              active income. Their homes are at risk of being, and frenquently are, completely wiped away by major hurricanes. For example, Fort Myers Beach, Florida may 
              have experienced the worst devastation during Hurricane Ian. A 15-foot storm surge rushed onto the coast causing 150 deaths and all kinds of older homes, especially 
              mobile ones in places like Fort Myers Trailer Park and Poinsetta Mobile Home Park. Newer brick-and-mortar homes fared the storm amazingly well, on the other hand. 
              Thus, in the coming decades, as Florida experiences more and more major hurricanes, climate change is posing a severely disproportionate, deadly risk to economically 
              disadvantaged Floridians.

        <h3> Wind Fields</h3>
            <p> The deadliest symptom of a hurricane is not pelting rain or flooding, but winds. Extreme wind speeds tear apart the thin metal and wooden exteriors of mobile homes and 
                cause storm surges dozens of feet tall that pull homes right off of their foundations. So, for my map, how many mobile home parks were at risk during or fell victim to 
                Hurricane Ian's strongest wind field. Further, how many of these parks would be at risk in the event of an even stronger hurricane that could follow a similar path.
